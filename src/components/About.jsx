            <h3>Simplifying Daily Commute in Chakwal</h3>
            <p>
              This project was built to solve a real problem — the people of Chakwal had no reliable
              way to know when their bus would arrive. Whether travelling to work, school, or between
              cities, timing matters.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tracker covers all three major bus routes operating in Chakwal District, with
              stop-by-stop arrival times calculated from the official schedule. Data is updated
              automatically based on the current time.
